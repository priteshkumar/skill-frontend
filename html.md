## DOM
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure
wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. **The DOM represents a document with a logical tree**. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, style or content of a document. 
Nodes can have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.[2]
