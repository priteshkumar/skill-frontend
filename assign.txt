2- The call flow explains website rendering in browser :

a) URL to IP address lookup call flow:

website url entered in address bar -> browser searches for url's IP address in browser cache and os cache -> if not found searches for IP addr in local network's router cache -> if not found router forwards the dns lookup request to ISP -> ISP responds back with correct IP address for the website URL .

b) Once the browser has IP address of the webserver(hosting the website), it initiates TCP connection with the webserver.

on successful connection , browser sends HTTP request for the webpage residing at root of website url.

Remote webserver responds back with the website's webpage corresponding to the website url.

Browser renders the webpage content on user screen.
