## Front-End Journey: From Mockups to Code

> [UX/UI phases](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/Best_Practices/Development/Front-End_Journey%3A_From_Mockups_to_Code)

- Starts with a UX Concept, where you’ll try to translate the business requirements into some workflows and wireframes.

- Then goes to a UI Designer that will create High-Fidelity mockups to provide a good overview on what the application would look like.

- Next step is the Front-End Development, where we convert the mockups into application screens and user interactions.


### Wireframing

> wireframe is a **blueprint/schematic** which tells about the structure  of a website(helpful for communicating the structure to coders/designers).

> wireframes are essential in creating a good interface structure for a website (avoids hard adjustments later in coding phases).

> UX wireframes represent the basic layout of any webpage and focus solely on the size, placement, and relationship of key interface elements.

>  Wireframes help your team make important decisions – early in the game – about user flow, information hierarchy, and page density.

### Mockups
> Product mockup builds on the rough sketch of **wireframe** in order to visualize more detailed content and demonstrate basic functionalities.

> UI Mockup templates can help your team get vital feedback during the early stages of design – and pave the way for fully interactive prototypes and design testing.
