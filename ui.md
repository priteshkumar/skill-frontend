### Wireframing/mockups

> wireframe is a **blueprint/schematic** which tells about the structure  of a website(helpful for communicating the structure to coders/designers).

> wireframes are essential in creating a good interface structure for a website (avoids hard adjustments later in coding phases).

> UX wireframes represent the basic layout of any webpage and focus solely on the size, placement, and relationship of key interface elements.

>  Wireframes help your team make important decisions – early in the game – about user flow, information hierarchy, and page density.

### Mockups
> Product mockup builds on the rough sketch of **wireframe** in order to visualize more detailed content and demonstrate basic functionalities.

> UI Mockup templates can help your team get vital feedback during the early stages of design – and pave the way for fully interactive prototypes and design testing.
